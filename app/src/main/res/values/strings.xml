        Federation?</string>
    <string name="question28">Did I understand correctly that if I just want to keep uptime,
        is it enough to have the prover turned on? If I want to mine,
        do I need to turn off the prover and start the Aleo client?</string>
    <string name="question29">Does the testnet still work?</string>
    <string name="question30">Guys I have a question, I need help. On which Fireside or Community
        Call can I present my project in English?)</string>
    <string name="question31">I mine on three cards 3080, the hashrate in the miner writes 2000
        from each one. But in the statistics on damominer.hk 3.03K P/s is displayed,
        it should be 6K P/s, or not?</string>
    <string name="question32">Hi all. On the website of the danomainer, they write connect to our
        pool and you can dig without your own node. It begs the question. If you have your own node,
        can you connect to it?</string>
    <string name="question33">If you take a GTX 1060 3 gb ti for mining and put it on mining.
        How many coins will she bring in a month? And in general, does it make sense to put this
        video for mining? I just see that everyone puts on 3090.
        So I asked myself this question.</string>
    <string name="question34">Greetings. This question has probably been asked before,
        but I will ask again. Can anyone explain why they give the role of ambassadors and generally
        keep the RU branch if the Russian Federation is in the bath?</string>
    <string name="question35">I try to catch the logic, 32 RAM or 40 which is better? I mean,
        as I saw in the requirements, itâ€™s always 8,16,32,64, so I think if you take 40 it will be
        better or 32 or 64, that is, that the gap between them will not change
        the weather or not?</string>
    <string name="question36">Is using multiple servers with 24 threads, say 2 servers 24=48,
        is it the same as using one server with 48 threads?</string>
    <string name="question37">Guys, is there an option like in fish to limit the number
        of threads used?</string>
